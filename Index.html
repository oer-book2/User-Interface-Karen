                    "In my definition, the humanities not only include literature of both
                    ancient and modern languages, the performing arts, philosophy,
                    comparative religion, and cultural studies, but also history,
                    anthropology, and linguistics, although the latter three are often
                    on the border between humanities and the social sciences."

                <p> “Fantasy is escapist, and that is its glory. If a soldier is imprisioned by the enemy, don't we
                    consider it his duty to escape?. . .If we value the freedom of mind and soul, if we're partisans of
                    liberty, then it's our plain duty to escape, and to take as many people with us as we can!”

                    “I can only note that the past is beautiful because one never realises an emotion at the time. It
                    expands later, and thus we don't have complete emotions about the present, only about the past.”

                    "Mathematics, as much as music or any other art,
                    is one of the means by which we rise to a complete
                    self-consciousness. The significance of mathematics resides
                    precisely in the fact that it is an art; by informing us of the
                    nature of our own minds it informs us of much that depends on our
                    minds."

                    even, or even different parts of the same continuum, but rather, they are manifestations of the
                    same thing. The arts and sciences are avatars of human creativity.""
