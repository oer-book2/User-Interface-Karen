                    "In my definition, the humanities not only include literature of both 
                    ancient and modern languages, the performing arts, philosophy, 
                    comparative religion, and cultural studies, but also history, 
                    anthropology, and linguistics, although the latter three are often 
                    on the border between humanities and the social sciences."

                                The difference between science and the arts is not that they are different sides of the same coin even, or even different parts of the same continuum, but rather, they are manifestations of the same thing. The arts and sciences are avatars of human creativity.
